A fast gradient boosting framework on manifolds(from regression tree,classification tree,neural net....).

##### 1) Use much less memory than LightGBM for large data problems 
Share memory with pandas dataframe or numpy ndarray.


##### 2)Some novel algorithms.Faster than LightGBM with same accuracy. 

##### 3)sklearn-like api interface.

##### 4)Support parameters of LightGBM.
